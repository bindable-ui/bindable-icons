# Bindable Icons

Bindable Icons is an optional icon set that can be used with [Bindable](). Both Bindable and Bindable-Icons are built as an [Aurelia plugin]() and work with [Aurelia JS](). The [`c-icon`]() component in Bindable places svg icons on the page by pointing to a svg map that this plugin creates. If you choose not to use Bindable Icons you would need to include your own svg map in your app. You can get [more info about svg maps here](). 

## Install

`npm install `

## Usage

Place this in your code base.

`sample`

Place this where you would like the svg map placed in your code.
